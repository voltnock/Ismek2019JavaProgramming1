- Can't include ( - ) dash character but can include underscore ( _ ).
- Its first character must be particularly a capital letter.
- What is a class? They are pages where we can write Java codes.

- Methods: Methods are structures doing operations.
- Methods can return a value. If a method is not returning a value, its type is void.
- If a method is not void, it must return a value.
- Methods return values with return keyword.
- Methods can receive arguments (parameters) in their paranthesis.
- There can't be any other codes later than return line in the method's scope, if return is used.
- Return keyword can't be used in a void method.
- Return keyword should be used only once in the method, if the method is not void.
- Method Access Identifiers: Public, Private, Protected
- Public methods can be called from classes other than the class the method is inside.
- Protected methods can be called from their own classes and their child classes.
- Private methods can only be called from their own classes.
### 18.12.2019 Wednesday
- There can be more than one method with the same name in the same class, given that their parameters list (their signature) are not identical. This is called method overloading.
